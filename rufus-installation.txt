Before you all install WIN10 Pro or what ever WIN10 (Ultimate), please, set the BIOS correctly. 
Please, stop into BIOS (CMOS), and disable CSM (Compatibility Support Mode). Every BIOS these days
is UEFI BIOS, especially on 64bit machines, since every 64bit BIOS is UEFI capable automatically.

You need also to set proper GFX mode in BIOS. If you use legacy, you need to set vBIOS mode, if UEFI: GOP mode.

Then you need to place WIN10.iso file on the USB stick. Please, use rufus 3.1 (https://rufus.ie/)
for that, with proper UEFI settings:
Partition scheme: GPT
Target system: UEFI
File system: FAT32
Cluster size: 4096

Every Linux distro these days is UEFI capable. Please, do note that. So, after installing WIN10
you can go ahead and install any Linux (if there is a free space on the HDD, or add another HDD),
not touching BIOS.

One final advise: if you do NOT need Legacy, do set everything ONLY to use GPT scheme and UEFI
mode. Mixes are allowed, but if you do NOT know what are you doing, mixes can be deadly obstacles.
